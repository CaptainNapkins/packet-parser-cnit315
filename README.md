# WireMinnow
This is the CNIT 315 final project. This network packet parser can output to a file and display results.

## Usage

1. Compile the program using a C compiler (e.g., GCC):
    ```
    gcc -o packet_manipulation packet_manipulation.c -lpcap
    ```

2. Run the program:
    ```
    ./packet_manipulation
    ```

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the program:
    - Start/Stop packet capture
    - Modify packet behavior
    - Exit the program

## Requirements
- C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- libpcap library

## Authors
