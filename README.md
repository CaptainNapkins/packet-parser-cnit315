# packet-parser-cnit315
This is a place for the CNIT 315 final project. I'm planning on a network packet parser that can output to a file and upload results via some API, perhaps. 

Snappier name is coming soon

## Standard Operating Procedures
1. All work can be done on branches
2. When done, commit to branch and push changes
3. Then open a pull request to be merged into main

## Usage

1. Compile the program using a C compiler (e.g., GCC):
    ```
    gcc -o packet_manipulation packet_manipulation.c -lpcap
    ```

2. Run the program:
    ```
    ./packet_manipulation
    ```

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the program:
    - Start/Stop packet capture
    - Modify packet behavior
    - Exit the program

## Requirements
- C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- libpcap library
